ExpressJS - Templating
-- Pug is a templating engine for Express.
-- Templating engines are used to remove the cluttering of our server code with HTML, concatenating strings wildly to existing HTML templates.
-- Pug is a very powerful templating engine which has a variety of features including filters, includes, inheritance, interpolation, etc.


Important Features of Pug
-- Let us now explore a few important features of Pug.

Simple Tags
-- Tags are nested according to their indentation.
--We don’t need to close tags, as soon as Pug encounters the next tag on same or outer indentation level, it closes the tag for us.

-- To put text inside of a tag, we have 3 methods −
1) Space seperated

h1 Welcome to Pug

2) Piped text

div
| To insert multiline text,
| You can use the pipe operator.

3) Block of text

div.
But that gets tedious if you have a lot of text.
You can use "." at the end of tag to denote block of text.
To put tags inside this block, simply enter tag in a new line and
indent it accordingly.

-- Comments
--- Pug uses the same syntax as JavaScript(//) for creating comments.
--- These comments are converted to the html comments(<!--comment-->).

For example,

//This is a Pug comment
This comment gets converted to the following.

<!--This is a Pug comment-->


2) Attributes
-- To define attributes, we use a comma separated list of attributes, in parenthesis.
-- Class and ID attributes have special representations.
--The following line of code covers defining attributes, classes and id for a given html tag.

div.container.column.main#division(width = "100", height = "100")

<div class = "container column main" id = "division" width = "100" height = "100"></div>


3)Passing Values to Templates
-- When we render a Pug template, we can actually pass it a value from our route handler, which we can then use in our template.

4) Variables in template
--We can also use these passed variables within text.
--To insert passed variables in between text of a tag, we use #{variableName} syntax.

5) Conditionals
-- We can use conditional statements and looping constructs as well.

If a User is logged in, the page should display "Hi, User" and if not, then the "Login/Sign Up" link.
