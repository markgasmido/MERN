app.get(route, callback)
-- This function tells what to do when a get request at the given route is called.
--- The callback function has 2 parameters, request(req) and response(res).
--- The request object(req) represents the HTTP request and has properties for the request query string, parameters, body, HTTP headers, etc.
--- Similarly, the response object represents the HTTP response that the Express app sends when it receives an HTTP request.

res.send()
-- This function takes an object as input and it sends this to the requesting client.
-- Here we are sending the string "Hello World!".

app.listen(port, [host], [backlog], [callback]])
-- This function binds and listens for connections on the specified host and port.
-- Port is the only required parameter here.


Install Curl
--Curl is a popular command line tool often used for making HTTP requests.
-- Curl supports a wide variety of other protocols, but, as a Node.js developer, you'll most likely use it to make HTTP requests to RESTful APIs.

app.method(path, handler)
-- This METHOD can be applied to any one of the HTTP verbs – get, set, put, delete.
